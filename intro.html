    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <img src="./Images/Male_and_female_chicken_sitting_together.jpg" alt="Chicken" />
    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red jungle <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, originally from
        India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
        sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced
        in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
        literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt
        in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
        and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.[7][8] vvvvvvvvv</p>

    <h1>Behavior</h1>
    <h2>Social behaviour</h2>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]

        Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists of a
        young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff
        up its feathers.[35]bbbbbbbbbbbbb</p>
